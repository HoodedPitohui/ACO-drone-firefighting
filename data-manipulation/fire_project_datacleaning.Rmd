This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
Load the data:

```{r}
library("readxl")
ORIG_TABLE <- read_excel("uncleaned-wa-dnr-data.xlsx")
ORIG_TABLE
```
Create a column with the fire type, sector, and objectid
```{r}
env_data <- ORIG_TABLE[c(1, 7, 12, 13, 32, 33, 40)]
env_data
```
Create a 
```{r}
fire_int_data <- ORIG_TABLE[c(1, 14, 17, 26, 29)]
fire_int_data
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
