# ACO-drone-firefighting
Source code for the following paper, by Karthik Shaji, Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Aerospace Engineering
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511430.3511462

Code Contains (in either current or past commits):
-3D TSP Solvers using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)
-Rudimentary Greedy Optimization Capacitated Vehicle Routing (CVRP) Solver
-ACO CVRP Solver for fire intensities and known locations
-Fire datasheets from WA DNR, R data pre-processing code to clean data for ACO

In-Progress:
-Adding GA CVRP Solver for fire datasets
-Working on obtaining additional natural disaster data for further CVRP Solver testing
