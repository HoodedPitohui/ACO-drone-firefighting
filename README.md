# ACO-drone-firefighting
AP Research Project:
Designing path planning for fire fighting drone swarm resource allocation. I treat this as a 2D Capacitated Routing Vehicle Problem (CVRP).
All the simulation is done using MATLAB, data pre-processing is done in R (due to ease of manipulating data frames)
